# AQI-Analysis-using-LLM

* A workflow which will incremental ingest AQI data from different location in delhi.
* Perform required transformations on it.
* Create view on top of it and also append to a table for historical purposes.
* And then with the help of Streamlit there is an application which will use OpenAI model for querying data from that view and provides AQI related questions.
